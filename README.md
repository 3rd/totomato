# Project: Totomato

## Summary

**Totomato** is a simple, minimalistic Pomodoro application. It can be customized to fit your needs. Totomato works on the web, but also on Linux/Mac/Windows as a stand-alone application. I built it to learn Vue.js basics.

## Get Totomato

Feel free to use the online version of Totomato: [http://totomato.seclab.co](http://totomato.seclab.co)

Alternatively you can download the stand-alone version for your platform: ~~not released yet~~

## Clean, minimalistic design

Totomato's design was inspired by **Joel Pendleton**'s creation, published on Dribbble [(link)](https://dribbble.com/shots/2405612-Minimalist-Pomodoro-Timer).
